# Utilities

The `utilities/` directory is for simple utility classes that lies in giving you access to every small concept of your design system, in a slew of contexts.

These classes are meant to be used only for making minor changes in elements without needing to make any CSS changes. By default most of the css properties defined in the utility classes have !important attribute to ensure that the classes work as expected by overiding values for the element.

The directory also contains a style sheet specifically for printing.
