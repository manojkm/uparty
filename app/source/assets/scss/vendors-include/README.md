Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility‚Äù.
The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. This is handy when using prepackaged 
components developed by other people.

This file is for you to import other libraries that you would like to
include into your project.

The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. This is handy when using prepackaged components developed by other people (or for your own components that are maintained in another project). jQuery UI and a color picker are examples of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory. As a general rule I make it a point not to modify files in my vendor directory. If I need to make modifications I add those after the vendored files are included in my primary stylesheet. This should make it easy for me to update my third-party stylesheets to more current versions in the future.
