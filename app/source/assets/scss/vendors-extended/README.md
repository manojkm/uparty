If we have to override a section of any vendor, in vendors-extensions/ we create files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite.
For instance, vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrapâ€™s default CSS.
This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
