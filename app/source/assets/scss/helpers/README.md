# Helpers

The `helpers/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function, mixin, placeholder and so on should be put in here.

*Note - The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.*
